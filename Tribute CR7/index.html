            Cristiano Ronaldo was born in Funchal, Madeira, Portugal, on February 5, 1985. He grew up in a poor family with three siblings and his father, who was a gardener and an equipment manager for a local football club.
             He developed a passion for football at an early age and started playing for Andorinha, a small amateur team, when he was seven years old. 
             He later joined Nacional, a bigger club in Madeira, where he impressed with his skills and speed. He moved to Lisbon when he was 12 years old to join Sporting CP,
             one of the top clubs in Portugal, where he received his education and training at the club’s academy. He made his debut for the senior team when he was 17 years old in 2002, and scored two goals in his first game. 
             He attracted the attention of several European clubs, such as Manchester United, Barcelona, and Real Madrid, with his dazzling performances and potential. 
             He signed for Manchester United in 2003, after impressing Sir Alex Ferguson, the manager of the club, in a friendly match.
              He became the first Portuguese player to play for Manchester United and the most expensive teenager in English football history at the time.
